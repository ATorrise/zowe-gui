"Command Error:
Internal Error: No profiles of type \\"blah\\" were loaded for this command.
Error Details:
This error can occur for one of two reasons:
 - The \\"profile\\" property on the command definition document does NOT specify the requested profile type
 - The profile type is marked \\"optional\\", no profiles of type \\"blah\\" have been created, and the command handler requested a profile of type \\"blah\\" with \\"failNotFound=true\\"
"
